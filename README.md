# Mapping_Earthquakes

The intent of this project was to create a map visualization of recent earthquakes using JavaScript and the Leaflet library. The project included adding a control box to toggle different base map layers and data sets. The final result includes the Street, Satellite, and Dark map layers and overlays for all recent earthquakes, earthquakes above 4.5 magnitude, and tectonic plates. The earthquake focal point is shown as a circle marker with size and color scaled to its magnitude. The major earthquakes above a 4.5 magnitude have a popup that shows the magnitude and a description of the location.
